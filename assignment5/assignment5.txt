ASSIGNMENT 5

pig is a dice game where two players compete to be the first to reach 100 points. 
players earn points by rolling one die. the number rolled equals the number of points earned. 
players continue to roll and add points until they choose to HOLD and total all of the points from their turn 
OR until the player rolls a 1. If the player rolls a 1, they recieve no points for their turn. 
the first player to exceed 100 wins. I would like to do this assignment to have a program that I can 
develop and an algorithm I can refine over time to continue practicing my programming. The game is also a nice 
follow up to 

PSEUDOCODE
player chooses whether they want to play against a friend or against the computer
if the user chooses to play against the computer
start with a roll. use a variable to sum the rolls in a turn until they choose to hold their points which I will store in an object.
if the user rolls a one they lose all their points for the turn and it's the computer's turn.
switch to the computers turn. have the computer roll until they roll a 1. I will track the points in a similar way as 
with the user's rolling algorithm. 

if the player chooses to play against a friend, the same rules apply but rather than computer "AI".
use an array of objects to make different players and use those objects to store values. 
loop through the array of objects and whichever is the first to 100 wins!
