checkbook program

use a class to store the checkbook array
use functions within the class to compile account balance,
total merchant visits and amounts spent at each merchant

all within class:
use usertext.substr() from the first position until ':' for the first entry
check to see if it is a deposit and add money to the account if not take money out of the account

use usertext.substr() from ':' to ':' to get the second entry
use a loop to compare if it's the same merchant and use a variable to increase the
trips to the merchant and sum the amount spent

main

close file

use the formatting and output from lab 19 to organize and display the elements of each array
calling the class to output the functions
